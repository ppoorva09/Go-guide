# Go-guide

Project Overview

Go-Guide is a hotel and restaurant recommendation system that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis on large-scale review data to provide personalized recommendations for travelers. 
The system analyzes reviews scraped from TripAdvisor, identifies important themes, and recommends hotels and restaurants based on user preferences, location, and sentiment.
This project demonstrates the integration of data scraping, NLP, sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and web development to build a user-friendly recommendation tool.
